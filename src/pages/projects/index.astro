      Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety
      of projects. This section is dedicated to showcasing those projects,
      diving into the why behind their creation, the how of their development,
      and the tech stacks I utilized. Additionally, Iâ€™ll share the challenges I
      encountered along the way and the solutions I implemented to overcome
      them.
